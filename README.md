## How to get started with development

Firstly I recommend developing on a Unix based system because it's a pain to get working on Windows.

1. Install Rust through the rust website or simply by running `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` in the shell
2. Install Node.js if you have not already
3. Clone this repository
4. Open the directory in the shell and run `npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli`
5. You're ready to get started with development. To build and run the code run `npm run tauri dev`

If there's trouble contact me or refer to the [Tauri install](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) and the [Rust install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
